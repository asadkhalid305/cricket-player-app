## Project Breakdown

This application is a [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) comprised of two apps and various packages that are shared across both apps. This is how the scaffolding looks:

### Apps

In the project, there's an `apps` folder which contains two applications:

1. api
2. client

**api**\
This app is an Express.js project with a basic setup that exposes several APIs. The following is the list of endpoints:

```text
/countries
/players
/players/:id
/players/:id/career
```

These endpoints return information about all the countries in the world and the players in each country.
This data is fetched through a public API [sportsmonks](https://docs.sportmonks.com/cricket)

**client**\
This app was built in NextJs 14. It has two main parts

1. Frontend Part
2. Server Part

In the Frontend we have all the components as usual which takes care of the UI.
In the Server, we have implemented a Backend for Frontend (BFF) logic.

This is how our server (BFF) is handling Frontend requests.

![BFF](https://github.com/asadkhalid305/backend-for-frontend/assets/23138058/c21fba56-292c-4539-882d-47fa80b04ba2)

### Packages

In the project, there's a `packages` folder which have five packages i.e.

1. config-eslint
2. config-tailwind
3. config-typescript
4. jest-presets
5. logger
6. types

**config-eslint**. **config-tailwind**, **config-typescript**, and **jest-presets** are libraries that are used across both apps or meant to be in future.

**logger** is a custom package which wrapps around console.log to supress eslint warnings and keep the logs of applications.

> Note that logger has two functions i.e. `logClient` and `logAPI`

**types** is custom package which contains types that are shared across the apps.
